## Project 4, *Links*

This is a demo/starter repo for the fourth project in [*Typography and Interaction*](https://typography-interaction-2324.github.io): 

> Students will collaboratively assemble, connect, and present a collection using [Are.na](https://www.are.na) as a platform/Content Management System (CMS)—and will then design and build an interface to browse it, using their Application Programming Interface (API).
